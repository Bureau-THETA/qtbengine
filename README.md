# The Quantification Engine. 
## Predict. Prepare. Prevent.
## Trusted worldwide morbidity-based forecasting of medicinal products right inside your health IT stack
### 📌 Project Overview

The Quantification Engine is the definitive open-source software library for empowering health information systems with precise, validated forecasts of medicinal product needs, driven by robust, data-backed morbidity models. Built for pioneers in health digitization, the Quantification Engine delivers a powerful, fully customizable decision-support engine that adapts seamlessly to local practices and priorities.

The health and logistics records are sources of the input data. The output is a forecast for a period given:
-	Stock on hand
-	Stock dispensed
-	Stockouts and expiration losses that may occur

The result: **smarter decisions, stronger systems, and healthier populations**.
