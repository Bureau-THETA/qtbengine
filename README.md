# The Quantification Engine

The QuanTB Engine is a free, open-source software library and desktop application that intends to develop quantification services for medicinal product stock, considering various consumption and replenishment scenarios.
	
QuanTB Engine implements quantification through the morbidity method. The source data for quantification includes the prognosis period, orderâ€™s lead time,  monthly morbidity, treatment assignments, medicinal products stock, and stock replenishment orders. The result is daily quantification that includes stock, completed consumption, missed consumption, and replenished quantity. The daily quantifications are available for all days in the prognosis period.

QuanTB Engine consumes logistic parameters, order, and stock data from the Logistic Information Management Systems (LIMS). The non-personal data morbidity and treatment assignments come from Health Information Management Systems (HIMS). 

Quantification services facilitate supply chain optimization for Logistic Information Management Systems (LIMS). Additionally, quantification services for Health Information Management Systems (HIMS) offer early warnings of stockouts or expirations while optimizing expenses.

The Medicinal Products Digital Solutions Consortium is responsible for QuanTB Engine sustainability, world-class consulting and learning services, and community maintenance.
	Free software, affordable consulting fees, and the opportunity to earn income through consulting services contribute to low total ownership costs.
