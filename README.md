# The Quantification Engine
## Predict, Prepare, Prevent.Trusted worldwide morbidity-based forecasting of medicinal products right inside your health IT stack
### 📌 Project Overview

Our **open-sourced Java-based software library** empowers **public health agencies, global health organizations, academic institutions, health tech innovators**, and **pharmaceutical companies** with accurate, data-driven forecasts of future medicinal product needs using the **morbidity method**.

In use for many years across more than 60 countries, the library is designed to integrate seamlessly with **reported and estimated morbidity data**. It provides **transparent**, **scientifically robust projections** that are **fully customizable to local demand patterns**—helping optimize resource allocation, minimize stockouts, and ensure better preparedness for future health needs.

The result: **smarter decisions, stronger systems, and healthier populations**.

## 📁 Project Structure

The `qtbengine` repository is organized to help you explore, understand, and use the library effectively:

- **`bin/`** — Contains the ready-to-use library compiled under Java 21.
- **`doc/`** — Contains real-world use cases to help you understand how the library applies to various scenarios.
- **`examples/`** — Includes step-by-step guides and runnable examples to get you started with the library quickly.
- **`qtbengine/`** — The heart of the project. This folder contains the Java source code that implements morbidity-based forecasting logic.

> ✨ Whether you're a developer, researcher, or planner, you can jump straight into `examples/` or dive into `doc/` to see real-world scenarios of the qtbengine application.
